    """
    The EnergyPlusPlugin class is the base class for all Python Plugin classes.
    Derived classes should inherit from this class and override at least the main function.
    Optionally, the initialize() method can be overridden to allow for one-time initializations to be made without
    having to override the constructor and set one-time flags, etc.

    This base class instantiates the EnergyPlus API and makes it available to derived classes through the `self.api`
    member variable.  Scripts can then access the functional API through `self.api.functional` and the data exchange
    API through `self.api.exchange`.

    This base class also creates a convenience variable: self.data which is a dictionary.  This is purely a convenience
    to allow derived classes to store data on the class without having to declare a variable in a custom constructor.
    Derived classes can ignore this and store data as they see fit.
