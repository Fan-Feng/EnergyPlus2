    <h2>Using EnergyPlus</h2>
    <p>
        Utilities and tools for creating, editing, and running input files that come with EnergyPlus include IDF Editor
        and
        EP-Launch. Many graphical user interfaces for EnergyPlus are available or under development. For the latest
        tools,
        please see
        <a href="https://www.buildingenergysoftwaretools.com/?capabilities=Whole-building+Energy+Simulation&keywords=EnergyPlus">
            this website for third party interfaces</a>. A completely new cross-platform version of EP-Launch has been
        developed
        and is available separate from the EnergyPlus install; see the <a
            href="https://ep-launch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#ep-launch">documentation</a> for more
        information.
        Some tools may produce out of date IDF files; you can then use the IDFVersionUpdater program to convert older
        files to current EnergyPlus version (you may need to use the Multiple Version Conversions set – see below).

                        Put a pin in that library question for a moment.  For a majority of users, EnergyPlus is still
                        basically the same tool, but with some great new features, bug fixes, and runtime performance
                        improvements.  Running EnergyPlus can still be accomplished the same way, by creating an input
                        file in IDF or EpJSON syntax, running the EnergyPlus(.exe) binary, and gathering results of
                        interest.  All this power is still available.  &#128077; <br>
                        However, for advanced usage, there are two significant changes that should be noted.  The first
                        is that user-defined EMS scripts can now be written as Python "plugins" that are executed by
                        EnergyPlus at runtime.  The second is that EnergyPlus can now be treated as a library, where a
                        client can make function calls to setup and execute a simulation, as well as interact with
                        simulation results <b>during</b> a simulation. &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
                        Details of these major changes along with other significant features for this version (hint:
                        there are a bunch!) are listed below in this readme.  Also, see the full

                    earlier version, it may not run in the newer version after conversion due to newer checks on the

    <p>A small subset of weather files that are available on the web site are also installed in the WeatherData folder.
        EnergyPlus uses these files directly for annual simulations. The Weather Converter program that is part of
        EnergyPlus can read these weather files and provide .csv (comma separated variable) as well as statistics
        reports
        about the included (or other) files. Weather data for more than 2100 locations in more than 100 countries can be
        downloaded on the <a href="https://energyplus.net/weather">EnergyPlus Weather Page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Important Changes (OK, back to this library thing...)</h2>
    <p>There are three changes in this release of EnergyPlus which rely on different software dependencies.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>C/Python API</dt>
        <dd>
            A significant change to this release is the ability to call EnergyPlus as a library.  Up until now, the way almost all
            users interacted with EnergyPlus has always been to setup an input file, and call the EnergyPlus(.exe) binary to run
            the file, then gather results as needed from output files.  (ExternalInterface being one exception).
            While this traditional method is still available, a new approach has been
            added.  The simulation code has been refactored to allow a C API to be created, exposing functions that enable users
            to register callback functions, call functional methods and interact with the simulation state.  Through this C API,
            a user may create a small C program that includes a callback function registered for each time step.  Then at each
            time step, this callback function then evaluates fluid property methods also via the API.  The function can also
            get access to instantaneous variable and meter data in the running simulation, and modify subsequent time steps
            by actuating controls and other aspects.  This unlocks the door for a whole new set of possible workflows.
            To link against this API, just point builds to the EnergyPlus install directory, which has a new "includes"
            directory with headers, and the EnergyPlus DLL right in the install root.
            Then, on top of the C API, a matching Python API was built that will allow this same functionality, but through
            Python scripts, further reducing the burden needed to create a workflow on top of EnergyPlus.  The functional
            API that exposes fluid property methods will be expanded over time to allow more and more access to internal
            calculations in EnergyPlus.  To link against this API, just point scripts into the EnergyPlus install directory
            and access API files from the pyenergyplus package in there.  More information about the API will be provided in
            a supplemental documentation source -- initially a PDF -- posted on the release page on GitHub.
            <b>Note that the API is in a preliminary state and is subject to break for the next release.  Subsequent
            releases will be more stable.</b>
        </dd>
        <dt>Python Plugins (Python EMS)</dt>
        <dd>
            The next change is the ability to use Python to write EMS scripts.  These scripts are currently nicknamed
            "plugins", as they are actually quite similar to the design of plugins for other software tools.  In these
            scripts, the user will write custom Python classes that override a predefined EnergyPlusPlugin base class.
            The user will then declare the plugin in their input file, along with some other plugin-related inputs
            (variables that can be shared between plugins, custom output variables, etc.).
            Based on which functions the user overrides, the functions will be called at specific points during a
            simulation.  The calling points are the same as those exposed for regular EMS functions.
            Once inside the called function, the plugin can then leverage the Python API discussed in the
            previous paragraph to read data, write actuators, and evaluate fluid/refrigerant properties.  In order to
            execute Python scripts at runtime, this EnergyPlus version includes a Python library with it, which can be seen
            if the install package is inspected.  Users should not need to mess around with this; this note is merely a tip
            for power users or people who do unusual things with the install package, that they need to watch this closer.
            Details about this new Python Plugin approach are found in the EMSApplicationGuide, InputOutputReference, and
            in the example files named PythonPlugin*.idf.
        </dd>
        <dt>GPU Calculations</dt>
        <dd>
            Another high impact change with this release is the ability to leverage GPU calculations to improve runtime
            performance of the simulation.  The documentation contains plenty of information to let users take
            advantage of this new feature, which has the potential to drastically speed up simulation runtime, however,
            a few notes provide high level tips for this new capability:
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    There is a performance overhead associated with passing calculations between the GPU and the CPU, with the

                    actual number where the GPU becomes more efficient will depend on the specs of the respective hardware.

                    Some machines (mostly server machines) do not have GPU hardware or the required graphics drivers to utilize
                    this capability. If this scenario is detected on a computer, EnergyPlus will issue a warning and proceed
                    with the simulation using the calculations on the CPU.

    <h2><a id="Installation_contents_100"></a>Installation contents</h2>
    <p>The installation creates a program folder with icons/shortcuts for the programs/files in EnergyPlus that can be
        accessed from Windows menus, including removing EnergyPlus from your system. In Windows OS, these will be
        available from the “Programs” area in the Start Menu. Note that only a few of the programs will store anything
        in your Windows\System directory (IDFEditor, EPLaunch, WeatherConverter).</p>
    <h2><a id="Known_problems_104"></a>Known problems</h2>
    <p>While every effort has been made to clean up all the “defects” that have occurred during our testing, quite a few
        known (and even more unknown) probably remain. Specifics on the remaining known problems can be found on the
        GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues">issues page</a>. If you are interested in
        what has been addressed, the issues resolved in this release are installed similarly in the
        <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.
